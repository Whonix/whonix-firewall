## Enable (1) or disable (0) transparent TCP proxying for the Whonix-Workstation.
## Any misc TCP traffic, for example /usr/bin/wget.anondist-orig (circumventing uwt wrapper)
## or any custom installed applications on the Whonix-Workstation will be

## WORKSTATION_TRANSPARENT_DNS as well.
WORKSTATION_TRANSPARENT_TCP=1

## Enable (1) or disable (0) transparent UDP proxying for the Whonix-Workstation.
## This setting has really no effect.
## The Tor network does not support UDP yet.
## This is not a Whonix specific limitation.
## There is a limited workaround for tunneling udp over Tor with Whonix:

## Enable (1) or disable (0) Control Port Filter Proxy for the Whonix-Workstation.
## It enables Whonix-Workstation to issue a limited set of safe Tor control port
## commands such as "SIGNAL NEWNYM", which enables Tor Browsers New Identity

## Torify Gateway / Hide the fact, that you are a Whonix user ##
################################################################

## For ensuring, that the Whonix-Workstation can only send traffic through Tor,
## it would not be required to route Whonix-Gateways traffic through Tor as well.
## Torifying the Whonix-Gateway prevents your ISP from knowing you are a Whonix user.
##
## This does NOT prevent your ISP from knowing you are a Tor user.
##    If you want this, read:
##    https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hide_Tor_and_Whonix_from_your_ISP
##
## Torifying the Gateway has the disadvantage, that apt-get operating system updates
## are slower. It also makes testing, developing and all kinds of special non-stock
## configurations more complicated. You can optionally disable this feature.
##
## Experts only! There is also the user clearnet on the Whonix-Gateway, which
## is allowed to make non-Tor connections.
##
## Allow (1) or forbid (0) the root user on the Whonix-Gateway to make non-Tor connections.
## Experts only!
ALLOW_GATEWAY_ROOT_USER=0
## Allow (1) or forbid (0) the user user on the Whonix-Gateway to make non-Tor connections.
## Experts only!
ALLOW_GATEWAY_USER_USER=0

## SSH into Whonix-Gateway ##
#############################

## This will simply open incoming port 22 in the Whonix-Gateway firewall.
## A port forwarding from the host to the Whonix-Gateway has still to be created,
## see SSH into Whonix-Gateway.
